            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </hi> It is falſe, that they pray vnto them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors onely: for they deſire them not onely to praie for them, but to haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpon them: For thus they praie, O bleſſed Ladie, haue mercy vpon vs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thy ſeruants, let the merites of S.

If God lift vp his hand, and execute any Iuſtice that may be ſéene, ſcarcely will men vouchſafe to regard it. But if he winke at thinges, and tarry patiently for the ſinners, wée thinke him to be aſléepe, and that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth not the world, but letteth all thinges goe at randome, without any minde to remedy them. Sée how bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh we be. But God ſheweth vs, that the wicked perſecutors ceaſe not to bée curſed euen in the middeſt of their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, &amp; that we néed not to ſpite them for their happy ſucceſſe, as they terme it: For they muſt be doubly puniſhed: ſo that it were farre better for them that they were miſerable, becauſe they ſhall pay ouer-déere for their pleaſures.</p>

                  </hi> that is, Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>wee preach, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing euery man, and teaching euery man in all wiſedome, that wee may preſent euery man perfect in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Therefore the glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, is called wiſedome, for that there we find, how
<pb facs="tcp:11412:15"/> to order our whole lyfe without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or erring.</p>
               <p>Although then that men bée full of ſubtilty and fine conueyance, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues to be very wiſe, yet muſt wée holde vs to that, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach vs, how it is in euery whit of it, but folly and vanity: for, for their folly in perſecuting the Saincts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, they ſhalbe confounded, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the feare of GOD is not in them. <hi>I haue,</hi> ſaith Eliphaz, <hi>ſeene the Foole taking roote, and immediatly I haue curſed his houſe.</hi> Whereas hée ſpeaketh of taking roote, hée meaneth, that it ſéemed likely, that his proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould be continual, firme, ſtable, and immoueable, like mount Sion, that cannot be remoued, but ſtandeth faſt for euer.</p>
               <p>If Eliphaz had ſaid, I haue ſéene the foole aduanced aloft to great dignitie, he had not expreſſed ſo much as he doth. For he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is planted,<note place="margin">Simil. Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, and Pharaoh.</note> he hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> déepe roote, becauſe the deſpiſers of God, haters and perſecutors of his Saints, hope to haue proſperity alwaies in their ſléeue. And like as a trée that is throughly
<pb facs="tcp:11412:16"/> well ſettled, and déepely rooted in the ground, ſtandeth faſt, though it bée ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with windes and ſtormes: euen ſo it ſéemeth, that after God hath once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced the wicked, they ſhall raigne continually, and their triumphes ſhall neuer haue an end. But Dauid and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz, when they ſawe this likelyhood, forbare not to curſe the wicked, out of hand, or immediatly, as Eliphaz ſaith: meaning, that they taried not till there came a chaunge, as wée commonly do, who at the firſt bluſh, when wée ſée the deſpiſers of GOD to be in their chiefe ruffe, and to haue the winde at their ſtearne (as they ſay) do linger the time, and are, as it were aſtoniſhed, ſaying, What will this matter prooue to? If we perceiue them to fall into decay, then wée chaunge our mind: but ſo long as wée ſée them flooriſh, then we know not what to ſay, wée be at our wittes end. Contrarywiſe, Eliphaz telleth vs, that hee was not abaſhed one whit at the matter, but ſpake his mind according to Gods holy word. For Dauid and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphazes iudgements and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here of the wicked, are not of their
<pb facs="tcp:11412:16"/> owne heads, or after their owne fancie, but they declare, that according as God ſheweth vs, that the wicked ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in the end, ſo they grounded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thereupon, and were not ſhaken therefrom by any temptation. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had ſéene the wicked flie ſo high a pitch, yet they held ſtill at one ſtay, ſaying, They ſhall come to nought, euen to confuſion. For euen as trées,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> though they ſéeme firmely rooted, when great and mighty ſtormes haue riſen, they haue béene caſt downe and pulled vp by the rootes, yea, the rootes turned vpwardes, yea, vtterly conſumed and burnt to aſhes: Euen ſo the wicked, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſeeme by their friendes, riches, alliances and aſſiſtances, to bée ſo firme as mount Sion, yet the Lord in his Iuſtice, that no fleſh ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in her owne ſtrength and power, hath ſent the ſtormes and windes of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and indignation, hath caſt downe, ouerturned, and vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the wicked. Now wée ſée in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what Dauid meaneth, whereas he ſaieth in his prayer to God, <hi>Let them be confounded that tranſgreſſe without
<pb facs="tcp:11412:17"/> a cauſe.</hi> And let vs apply this leſſon to our owne vſe, that wée may know how agréeable it is vnto vs. True it is, that wée haue not to doo with condemning of other men:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1</note> for it ſtandeth euery man in hand, rather to looke into himſelfe, and that is the thing wherevnto euery one of vs muſt apply his endeuour: for they that ſo raſhly iudge others, forget themſelues, and GOD will not ſpare them, though they flatter themſelues; they muſt be fayne to come before their Iudge, who will handle them rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they ouerſlippe themſelues ſo much in their owne faults. Let vs note then, that our mindes muſt not gadde here, and there, to ſéeke out the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill that is in others: but euery man muſt enter into himſelfe, and examine his owne ſtate and life, and when wée finde any fault in our ſelues, wée muſt condemne it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, where Dauid curſed his perſecutors, in ſaying, <hi>Let them be confounded that tranſgreſſe without a cauſe,</hi> who are wicked and deſpiſers of God: it is not to yéeld ſuch aucthority or preeminence to vs, as of our ſelues.
<pb facs="tcp:11412:17"/> How is it then? Firſt of all, if the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſecute or trouble vs, ſo as they doe vs any annoyance or wrong, wée imagine that GOD hath giuen vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and that he careth no more for vs; &amp; hereupon wée be tempted to conceiue a griefe, as though we had loſt our time by walking in ſingleneſſe and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſaying, How now? I looked that God would haue ſuccoured me at my néed: yea, I haue ſerued him, and I haue put my truſt in him, and yet he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mée to be tormented to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: I find not reliefe when I pray vnto him, he ſeemeth as though he were deafe.</p>
               <p>We ſée here a very troubleſome temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when GOD ſéemeth to make none accompt of ſuccouring vs, at ſuch time as men miſintreat and perſecute vs. And therefore to comfort our ſelues withall, we muſt practiſe this leſſon in all our troubles &amp; encombrances, which is, that although the wicked be in their triumph to day, ſo as they ſet their foote vpon our throate; it is not for that God hath forgotten vs, or for that he will not ſend vs remedie for it in the end: But
<pb facs="tcp:11412:18"/> let vs waite with patience, and we ſhal find the iſſue to be ſuch as God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; that is to wit, that he will regard vs with mercie. Now, when we ſée what profit redou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vnto vs by curſing, that is, by marking by the Scriptures, howe God curſeth the wicked, wée ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that there is nothing but vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their ſtate throughout. But let vs procéed yet further.<note place="margin">

But to the intent we be not prouoked to do amiſſe, we muſt take this for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that is, that when the deſpiſers of God, the perſecuters of his ſaints, ſéeme to be kings and princes, ſo as they take their pleaſure, and glorie in their eſtate,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:18"/> yet they ceaſe not to be accurſed. True it is, that this accurſedneſſe appeareth not at the firſt day; for it is ſecret, but it muſt haue leyſure and time to ſhewe it ſelfe.

And why: They neuer knew what it is, to haue a right iudgement in Gods will &amp; word, they are poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of pride: the ſpirite of ſound iudgement is farre from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; they ſcorne at our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, when to their demand, Who ſhal iudge of the true meaning &amp; ſence of the Scriptures, we ſay, The holy ſpirit ſhal, &amp; doth lead not onely the whole Church, but euery particular &amp; ſingular member of the Church, into all truth. <hi>Campianan ratione Sophiſmat.</hi> Alſo there are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, which could find in their harts to

                  <hi>The Vſe is:</hi> That wee magnifie the glorious name of our good and gratious Father, who ſo mercifully cauſeth vs the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wrath, to become his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by adoption, and aſſureth vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubting, of the continuance of his fauour towards vs.</p>
               <p>This doctrine of Gods fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the humble his children, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to our conſcience, and therefore the longer to be vrged and taught. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man naturally ſéeketh to comfort himſelfe: ſome by voluptuouſneſſe, ſome by worldly wealth, ſome by honors and reputations among men, which all are vaine. We ſée after what ſort men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelues: namely, by forgetting God. For it ſéemeth to them, to be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy matter to think vpon him. And in ſooth, how many are there that wil ſay ſtoutly enough, We are good Chriſtians?
<pb facs="tcp:11412:38"/> and yet notwithſtanding, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be merrie, they driue away all thought of God and eternal life, and not onely ſo, but alſo offend God of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. After what maner? They cannot be merry, dut in doing euil. Seing then that the nature of men is ſuch, &amp; that wée be attainted with that diſeaſe, let vs looke well to our ſelues, and be ſure that our mirth ſhall not be bleſſed from aboue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be aſſured of the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſins. Therfore if we haue Gods fauour, and pray to him, therein conſiſteth true gladnes, which is approued of God, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, &amp; will bring vs to euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. But ſo long as we know not in what caſe we are in with our God, nor ſeeke to be reconciled to him, but lie row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtill in our owne filthines, the more we deſire to be merry, the more we kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Gods ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance againſt vs, the more we encreaſe ſtill the fire of his wrath, &amp; we plunge our ſelues the déeper into his bottomles pittes.

               <p>Hereby we are taught, that we muſt néeds be in trouble &amp; vnquietnes, ſo long as we know not whether we be in Gods fauour. True it is, that the wicked will
<pb facs="tcp:11412:39"/> ſéeke meanes enough to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues merry, they ruffle it out, you ſée, in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God: but howſoeuer the world goe with them, yet he ſendeth them ſuch pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and torments of mindes, ſo as they be grieuouſly diſtreſſed; and if they dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it is as Moſes ſaith, namely, that yet neuertheles <hi>ſinne lieth at the doore:</hi> that is, tormenteth their conſciences, &amp; there waiteth for them like a dogge that waiteth for his maſter.</p>
               <p>Yée ſée then, that the wicked may ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle it out, but yet can they not goe out of their doores without gnawing of their conſciences, and GOD muſt ſtill hold them at that bay.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſo much the more ought wee to thinke vpon this doctrine, that we turne not our backe vnto God, nor burie our ſinnes when wée would haue peace, but that wée alwaies haue ſome promiſe of GOD to comfort vs. And when wée ſée that GOD allureth vs to ſaluation, let vs be glad thereof: for then ſhall our gladneſſe be bleſſed. And if wée haue the taſte, that GOD is our louing Father, it will ſwéeten, yea, it will ſanctifie all our ioyes: but without it
<pb facs="tcp:11412:40"/> wée muſt néeds quayle, and there is no other meanes for vs truely and in deed to reioice: Marke this. Alſo let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the onely grace of God ought to ſuffice vs, although we haue neuer ſo many ſorrowes mixt with it, according as God will exerciſe vs. For he in this our fraile life will not ſend vs full ioy, ſo as we may laugh with open mouth, as they ſay: yet not withſtanding, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth vs to reioyce in this certainty, that we haue him to our good and louing father, and that we ſhal find mercy with him. Then, if we haue this grace to call vpon God, and can aſſure our ſelues that the gate is open to vs, and that we in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall haue acceſſe vnto him: I ſay, if wée can haue that boldneſſe (not through our owne, raſhneſſe, but that he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to open his holy mouth to witneſſe his loue to vs, which thing he doth, when to vs his holy Goſpell is preached) then notwithſtanding, that many and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite were our temptations and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet he will comfort vs, and ſhe we himſelfe as a kind, comfortable, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing father vnto vs.</p>

               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt in the <hi>25.</hi> of S.

And therfore when the Angels came to him in the forme of men, hee is noted by the holy Ghoſt, to haue entreated them, yea, to haue (as it were) compelled them to eate meate in his houſe.

               <p>The Expoſition.</p>
               <p>By <hi>pathes</hi> in this place, the Prophet vnderſtandeth the whole regiment of God, wherewith hee ruleth all thinges that he hath created.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſence is:</hi> Whatſoeuer the Lord doth towards them that kéepe his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and teſtimonies, whether it be that he afflict them, or whether he ſuffer them to fal into ſin, he therby ſheweth mercy, &amp; kéepeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of his promiſe towards them. Temptations, wherwith Sathan aſſaulteth vs, are not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt afflictions,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:44"/> which God, as with a ſalue doth eure our ſoules with. When God giueth him power to wound the children of GOD, he permitteth it to humble them; to the end, that when they be ſo grieuouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and do yet ſtill reſiſt the aſſaults that are made vpon them, they ſhould vnderſtand,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> that that commeth not of themſelues, but that they bee vpheld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, that is to wit, by the grace of GOD, and by the power of his holy ſpirite.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe it is, that the Apoſtle Paul in the <hi>8.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Rom. 28. verſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Alſo we know, that al things worke for the beſt vnto them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, when God giueth Sathan leaue to tempt the faithfull, ordinarily it is to ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were with a<note n="*" place="margin">Euen as an hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though biting &amp; grieuous to the fleſh, doth cure the diſeaſes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: euen ſo temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren doe cure their ſoules.</note> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. And heerein we ſée the vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and wonderfull mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our gracious God, in turning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill into good. For what can Sathan and ſinne bring, but rancke poyſon and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim? Yea, hee hath nothing but death: for he is called the Prince of death. So
<pb facs="tcp:11412:44"/> then, whatſoeuer Sathan can effect, it turneth altogether to mans deſtruction, and to the drowning of them in endleſſe damnation. And yet notwithſtanding, God findeth meanes, whereby the euill that is in Sathan and in our ſelues, are turned to our good. And here we ſée, how S. Paul was cured, as it were,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</note> with a medicine, as he himſelfe confeſſeth, after he had ſpoken of thoſe high Reuelations which God gaue him. <hi>2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1.</hi>

                  <hi>It is not expedient for me, no doubt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce: for I will come to viſions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations of the Lord. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. I know a man in Chriſt; aboue fourteene yeeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, (whether hee were in the bothe, I cannot tell, or out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth) which was taken vp into the third heauen. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And I know ſuch a man, whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. How that hee was taken vp into Paradiſe, and heard words which cannot bee ſpoken, which are not poſsible for man to vtter. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Or ſuch a man will I reioyce, of my ſelfe will I not reioyce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it bee of mine infirmities. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. For though I would reioyce, I ſhould not be
<pb facs="tcp:11412:45"/> a foole, For I will ſay the truth, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine, leſt any man ſhould thinke of me aboue that hee ſeeth in me, or that hee heareth of me, &amp;c.</hi> to the end of the ninth verſe. God hath prouided for me, that I ſhould not exalt my ſelfe too much. Loe here a good preuiſion, and very profitable for him. For we know that pride is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to throw vs headlong into hell, and there is nothing that more prouoketh Gods diſpleaſure, then it: For hee muſt of neceſſitie ſhew himſelfe an enemie to the proude, and to ſuch as preſume aboue their owne ſtrength, after what maner ſo euer it bee. And S. Paul was in the ſame daunger, if God had not remedied it. In what ſort did hee it? It was (ſaith Paul) <hi>by ſending me the meſſenger of Sathan to buffet me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sée how Sathan worketh in S. Paul, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Gods permiſſion. And what was the iſſue? Queſtionleſſe, he meant vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue ouerwhelmed him, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to haue drawne him into wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, to the end that hee would haue him haue giuen ouer the ſeruice of God, and by little &amp; little to haue withdrawne himſelfe from Chriſtianitie, by reaſon of
<pb facs="tcp:11412:45"/> the weariſome miſeries and troubles, which he endured without ceaſing.</p>
               <p>Behold heere Sathans purpoſe. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, God purpoſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end to binde his deare ſeruant, that he ſhould not forget himſelfe, and ſo exalt himſelfe to the great diſpleaſure of God. For this cauſe he was <hi>buffetted.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth purpoſely chuſe the phraſe of <hi>buffetting.</hi> God vſed him not as a man of armes that fighteth in the fielde, to giue him a glorious victorie; but buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him like a boy, to his ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Thus the holy Apoſtle, whome God had endued with ſo excellent gifts of the holy Ghoſt, was ſo farre made an vnderling to Sathan, that he (as it were) ſpit in his face, and wrought him many other villanies.</p>
               <p>We ſée then, how God turneth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill into good, when hee maketh all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ſtings to ſerue vs as medicines, whereby he purgeth vs of the vices that Sathan hid in vs. And therfore we haue cauſe to praiſe God in al reſpects, yea, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> although at the firſt ſight, his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſéemeth to our imaginations ouer-boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, and that by our fleſhly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:11412:46"/> wee cannot vnderſtand them. When we haue well conſidered all theſe and many more of theſe his mercies, we ſhall euer haue wherewith to glorifie and magnifie our good God and father.</p>
               <p>To bee yet better confirmed in this truth, let vs conſider how afflictions ſerue for our profit and ſaluation.

                  </note> God holdeth the reynes in his handes, to guide men at his pleaſure: and if it pleaſe him to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our ſinnes, we haue nothing to reply why he ſhould not condemne vs: and if it pleaſe him of his great mercy wholy to pardon vs, who ſhall reſiſt him? who ſhall let him to ſhew vs fauour? True it is, that this is ſtrange to mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at the firſt ſight. For ſeing that God accepteth not the perſons of men, we aſke, wherefore he forgiueth ſome, &amp; forgiueth not otherſome? wherfore tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, ſeing him ſo diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Then may we trouble our heads, to be curious to know, wherefore doth the lord ſo deale? But what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt we make? Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only to refer al things to his wiſdome &amp; purpoſe, knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not in vs to rule him, &amp; we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend
<pb facs="tcp:11412:50"/> thoſe thinges that are aboue our reach. And if it pleaſe God to forgiue vs, let vs vnderſtand, that it is not for our deſerts, but of his frée mercy, through Ieſus Chriſt onely. And this muſt bee well marked, becauſe the matter that I haue already ſpoken of, comming naturally into mens imaginations, hath béene the cauſe, that falſe &amp; wicked doctrines haue ouerflowed in Chriſtendome.</p>

Haue wée then the feare of God before our eyes? Then without all doubt, all other things we eſtéeme not in compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doing him homage, ſeruice and honor, &amp; then we will wholly addict our ſelues to his ſeruice. It alſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the knowledge of our good God. Do wee know him? Then we do it in ſuch maner as hee hath vttered, &amp; made himſelfe to be knowen, &amp; not otherwiſe: that is, that he is our maker, our main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer, and one that hath ſhewed ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly goodneſſe towards vs, that wee of dutie ought to be obedient children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb facs="tcp:11412:51"/> him, if we will not be vtterly vnthankfull. The true feare of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo comprehendeth an acknowledging of his ſoueraigntie, rule, dominion, and ſuperioritie ouer vs, to the end that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs yéelding him his due honor, may learne to pleaſe him in all thinges. Thus yée ſée, that vnder this feare of GOD, is comprehended all Religion, all the ſeruice and honour which man a creature, oweth to GOD the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. There are alſo here, you ſée, two thinges to be conſidered: the feare of the Lorde, and an holy life. He whom GOD bleſſeth with the one, ſhall by his holy Spirite be directed to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Both which are the gracious gift of GOD, which hée giueth to none, but to them that are his. The meanes for the attainment both of the one and the other, is Prayer to our God; and all theſe goe together: for when by reaſon of our ſinnes wée are turned aſide from the feare of GOD and holy lyfe, and from praying vnto his diuine Maieſty, all our wiſedome is but follie, all our ſhewes of godlineſſe are but hypocriſie, all our knowledge is but ignorance, all
<pb facs="tcp:11412:51"/> are but a wind to make vs breake, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſepulchers, full of dead mens bones, faire without, but fowle within.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Feare</hi> importeth aſmuch, as that our life muſt be ruled according to the will of God. For what beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they know not, acknowledge not, yea, are not ſubiect, and obedient to the Lord their Maker? They like wild Colts, bruite beaſtes, and vntamed heyfers, ruſh foorth: and as the Prophet Hoſea ſaith, like a great riuer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſhea</hi> 4.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath bene ſtaied and dammed vp, the ſluces ſet open, &amp; the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me pulled down, breaketh forth into all lewdnes, abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and wickednes. Wée know or ſhould know, what our luſts are, how vntamed &amp; vnruly they are. Therfore if the feare of God raigne in vs, wée muſt, &amp; will acknowledge, that the Lord hath not ſet &amp; placed vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, to liue as we liſt, but reſerueth his whole intereſt, title &amp; right ouer vs, &amp; he expecteth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at our hands. Againe <hi>Feare</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that God requireth of vs, to learne to direct our whole life to his wil. It hath pleaſed him of his great mercy &amp; vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodnes, to giue vs his whole lawes
<pb facs="tcp:11412:52"/> and holy word, wherby as a ſcholmaſter teacheth his ſcholer, and as by the ſterne the maſter of the ſhip guideth it: euen ſo by the ſame hee directeth, guideth and teacheth vs what to do, what to leaue vndone, how to diſcerne betwéene that which is good, and that which is euill: Then we muſt here beginne. Salomon ſaith, <hi>The feare of the Lord is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of knowledge, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.7.</hi> Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, nothing can further vs in the feare of God, but onely the guiding, gouernance and direction of Gods holy Spirite. For is there any goodnes in the holieſt and vprighteſt of vs all? Are we giuen to any thing, but to all euill and wickednes? And if we lay Gods lawe, to mens liues, wée ſhall ſoone ſée as great a deadly battell betwéene them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene fire and water, yea euen our whole nature; and that there is nothing more contrary to the righteouſneſſe of God, then the affections of our fleſh. For as the Apoſtle S. Paul in the <hi>8.</hi> to the <hi>Rom. verſ. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </hi> They are, he ſaith not, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but <hi>enmity to God.</hi> Seing it is ſo, let vs pray vnto the Almighty: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as we are wholy giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:52"/> and are altogether caried away vnto euill, let vs zealouſly and earneſtly beſeech the Lord our God, to lay his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hand vpon vs, to direct and guide vs, to vouchſafe vs his holy and bleſſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to rule and gouerne vs in ſuch wiſe, as we may fréely and with ſingle harts lead an holy and godly life, cleaue vnto his righteouſnes, be obedient vnto his holy precepts, &amp; that of his louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he will not ſuffer the temptations of Sathan, to turne vs away from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: that it would pleaſe him of his goodneſſe to forgiue vs our ſinnes, &amp; be alwaies merciful &amp; louing towards vs.</p>
               <p>Praier ought to be ioyned with the feare of God, that by his bleſſed Spirite we might be guided in the way that we ſhould chooſe. For it ſufficeth vs not to be taught what wée ſhould do, what God requireth at our hands, and what is our dutie, but wee muſt repaire to him; let vs haue our whole recourſe to him, let vs ſéeke of him thoſe things that wée want; for he hath all things in ſtore for his children: and beyng ſicke in our ſoules, let vs runne to him our carefull and louing Phiſicion. This is a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:11412:53"/> Doctrine, and therefore I purpoſe the longer to inſiſt hereupon, knowing that this being well learned, wee haue profited well in one forenoone in the Schoole of Chriſt. You come oftentimes to the Sermons: what profiteth that, if we haue not the feare of the Lord (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many are farre from) &amp; liue not a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, &amp; pray not to him to guide vs by his holy ſpirite? We do but wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, if we bring not theſe things, &amp; heare not dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently: for wherfore is our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting hither? To know our dutie, what the Lord requireth at our hands, how we ought to walke, differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are more like beaſts than men. God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, but obedience to his lawes. For all the deuices of mens braynes are méere vanities, &amp; ſtarke folly. Mark how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſts torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues what gaine they by their fond deuices? For all their doings are but their owne deuices; the law of the Lord is, as though it were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried among them. So then, let vs take héed we deceiue not our ſelues: but let our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sermons, be an attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a certainty, wherin we may not faile: which thing wil then come to paſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:53"/> when we allow of &amp; admit nothing but onely Gods will to rule and gouerne our whole life. Howbeit that is not al that is to be done. For it is in vaine for men to beat their eares with preaching: which is, This you may do, this God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth you to doe; vntill ſuch time as we haue learned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is he only that giueth vs the feare of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is he onely, that by his holy ſpirit hauing giuen the firſt Grace, doth alſo to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue a ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that it is he onely, that imprinteth his Law in our harts, &amp; ingraueth it in our bowels, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is he only that giueth vs power to cleaue to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is he only which by his holy Spirit giueth force &amp; efficacy to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly doctrine, that it is he only which of his great goodnes &amp; tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy accepteth vs &amp; forgiueth vs our ſins: I ſay, it is al to no purpoſe, vntil we haue learned theſe things, &amp; pray vnto him for all things we ſtand in néed of. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more our faith alwaies enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth in vs a deſire to praiſe God, &amp; to pray vnto him. When the holy Miniſter preacheth vnto you, and ſaith that our louing Lord and ſwéete ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt hath of his mercies, not of your merits (for you haue
<pb facs="tcp:11412:54"/> none) reconciled you to God his father, and to waſh and clenſe you, hath ſhedde his precious bloud, that he hath paid the price of your ranſome, that by his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe you might be acquited, and by this meanes become holy and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to GOD our heauenly father: the knowledge of theſe things is, to the end wee ſhould throughly cleaue vnto him, &amp; ſay, What meanes haue we to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by, but onely by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frée grace of God, ſeing that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath of his infinite goodnes made full and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſatiſfaction for vs, and to the ende that our faith ſhould reſt therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But, may we lie ſtill, and ſléepe like Swine? No. No. We muſt awake, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre by Praier to God, &amp; ſay, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is our welfare? Euen in the death and paſſion of our Lord and ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus. Therfore we muſt ſeeke it there: for wée ſhall neuer finde it elſewhere, neyther with men nor Angels. And how muſt wee ſeeke it, but by Praiers and ſupplications?</p>
               <p>Then let vs pray vnto him, and ſay, O Lord, ſeing thou ſeeſt vs farre from all goodnes, giue vs the true feare of thee,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:54"/> ſend downe thy holy Spirite into our hearts, to reforme, renue and direct vs in our waies. True it is, we are wretched ſinners: but foraſmuch as we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſticall body of thy deare ſonne our ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus, we pray thee, make vs righteous through him. True it is, that we are polluted, and full of ſpottes; but his precious blood can cleanſe vs: we are guilty of euerlaſting death, and in bondage to it: but our ſweet Sauiour and Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſet vs free from it. Wherefore, O gracious God, fill thou vs with thy holy &amp; ſweete ſpirite, that by his ſtrength, wee in our pathes and waies that we haue choſen, may be ledde, and conducted; ſuffer vs not, for any temptation, to fall from thee.</p>

                  <hi>The vſe of the doctrine is.</hi> Let vs al, ſeing we would be in peace and dwell at eaſe, and deſire that our ſoules may enioy that which is good indéed, walke in the feare of the Lord: Let vs ſéeke peace, and enſue it.</p>
               <p>This eaſe and reſt, that God giueth vnto his children, is of diuers ſortes. For
<pb facs="tcp:11412:59"/> the faithfull haue that reſt, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures ſpeake of, which is: they leane vnto GOD, put their truſt in his goodneſſe, and doubt not but that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth them: hereupon they may ſleepe at their eaſe, as the Prophet Michah ſaith chapter <hi>4. <hi>verſe</hi> 4.

I will lay mee downe in peace, and take my reſt, for thou, Lord, onely makeſt mee dwell in ſafetie.</hi> And this peace is the fruite of faith, as Paul ſaith to the <hi>Rom. Chap. <hi>5.</hi> verſe <hi>1.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wée ſée then, that the chiefe reſt which men haue, or can enioy, is to committe themſelues to Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that in reſpect of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care ouer them, they can ſay, My good gracious GOD, and louing Father, I commend my ſoule, my bodie, lyfe, and all that I haue, vnto thy fauourable protection: they are in thy gracious hand, order and diſpoſe them according to thy good pleaſure and will; and I, by the aſſiſtance of thy good Spirite, purpoſe to walke in my vocation, to glorifie
<pb facs="tcp:11412:59"/> thée, to finiſh my courſe, and to kéepe the faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But beſides this alſo, there is another reſt and eaſe, not that which the deare Saints and children of God do enioy, but a reſt &amp; quietnes, which God ſometimes granteth to the wicked: For many times the Lord ſpareth, and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the wicked outwardly, although he within torment them with the biting and bitter gnawing of their conſciences, as Iſaiah the Prophet ſaith.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſ.</hi> 48.22 <hi>and</hi> 57.20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>But the wicked are like the raging Sea that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt, whoſe waters caſt vp myre and dirt. <hi>verſe</hi> 21. There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For although it be ſayd, that their thoughts are lyke waues beating one againſt another, yea, and as a ſinke that is filthy within, (becauſe infidelity doth alwaies bring vnquietnes) yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, God caſteth them into a ſléepe, becauſe hée puniſheth them not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly.</p>
               <p>So that, although that God deferreth and prolongeth the puniſhment of the wicked, let vs not be ouerhaſty. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by pleading againſt God,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:60"/> ſaying, Wherefore delayeth he the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked? That were as much as to trouble thoſe, whom God for a time will haue be at reſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs learne to ſubmit our ſelues pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to Gods will, and beware that wée runne not an head after that ſort. For it becommeth not the children of God, to make trouble, where God will haue quietnes. And therewithall let vs vnderſtand, that it is to no purpoſe to haue bodily proſperitie, except wée haue Gods fauour with it, that the feeling thereof may make vs quiet in our harts.</p>
               <p>Againe, if we haue not this quietnes, let vs pray to God to giue it vs. For it is he onely that can giue it vs. For if, as Iſaiah ſaith in the perſon of God,<note place="margin">Iſ. <hi>45.7.</hi> God only giueth vs quietnes &amp; peace, which to obtaine, wee muſt pray to him for.</note> 
                  <hi>I forme the light, and create darkneſſe, I make peace, and make euill:</hi> that is, if peace and warre be in his handes, and that in this vale of miſery he can and will giue trouble and eaſe, when it ſéemeth good to his heauenly wiſedome, much more hath he the ſpirituall reſt, which is farre greater and excellenter.</p>
               <p>Then let vs conſider, that it lieth not in vs, to quiet our ſelues when wée are
<pb facs="tcp:11412:60"/> in trouble, but we muſt reſort vnto God: for it is a ſingular and ineſtimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that commeth from him, to hold vs ſo in quiet, as wee may alwaies in the middeſt of the turmoiles of this world, abide ſtill vpon our feete; and that being toſſed, as it were, with great ſtormes and tempeſts, yet neuertheleſſe we haue our anchor ſtill faſtened in him to hold faſt our owne. This is a ſingular priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which God giueth his children.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, are wee in pouertie? haue we anguiſh, trouble and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Let vs frame our ſelues to take hold of this ſettled quietneſſe, ſeing the Lord giueth it to vs his deare children, that it might, to our comfort, abide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs.</p>
               <p>True it is, that wee muſt alwaies ſéeke the meanes that God offereth vs, to keepe vs to it, and to endeuour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it; but howſoeuer it be, let vs be fully reſolued of this, that it is God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that giueth it, and deliuereth vs from all vnquietneſſe. Therefore let vs not ſtorme, nor frette againſt the Lord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it pleaſe him to turmoile vs: For we are not taught in the word, that God
<pb facs="tcp:11412:61"/> will ſo handle vs in this world, that wée ſhall not be toſſed to and fro; wée haue no ſuch promiſe: yet let vs cleaue vnto God, and caſt our anchor on him: ſo ſhall wée not bée ouercome of temptations, although they be many and greeuous.</p>

               <p>The Prophet, no doubt alſo, by the eyes meaneth his corporall eies, which, as by an inſtrument, did draw vp his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>The reaſon is:</hi> All good things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer wée haue, GOD is the author thereof, of whom, in lifting vp our harts, we deſire the ſame.</p>
               <p>Example of lifting vp of the eies in prayer, is our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, both whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he prayed with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to his Father, when hée raiſed vp Lazarus from death, who foure daies
<pb facs="tcp:11412:69"/> lay buried in his graue; as alſo when he prayed to his father, not onely for his Diſciples, but for all that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, <hi>Iohn <hi>11.41.</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Iohn <hi>17.1. Therefore they tooke away the ſtone, where he was laid that was dead: and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus lifted vp his eies and ſaid, Father, I thanke thee, that thou haſt heard mee.</hi>
                  </hi> This is a token of a mind well framed to praier: for to the end a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call vpon GOD, he muſt be ioyned with him, which cannot bée, vnleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted vp aboue the earth, he aſcend vp aboue the heauens. This is not done with the eye onely, ſeeing that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who are drowned in the déepe filth and dregges of their fleſh, ſéeme with their ſterne countenance to draw heauen vnto them: but the children of GOD muſt ſincerely perfourme that, which hypocrites do but faine.</p>
               <p>Neyther yet muſt hee that lifteth vp his eyes towardes Heauen, there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude GOD in his cogitation, who is euery where, and filleth heauen and earth. But becauſe mens mindes can neither eſcape from, nor acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of groſſe inuentions, but when
<pb facs="tcp:11412:70"/> they be lifted vp aboue the world, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture called vs thither, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that heauen is Gods ſeat.</p>
               <p>As touching the lifting vp of eies, it is no continuall ceremonie which law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Praier cannot want: For the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, that praieth with his countenance towardes the earth, doth neuertheleſſe pearce the heauens with his faith. Yet that is a profitable exerciſe, whereby men awake, and ſtirre vp themſelues to ſéeke the Lord; yea, the feruentneſſe of prayer doth ſo affect and moue the body ſometimes, that beſides meditation, it doth willingly folow the mind. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is without all doubt, that when Chriſt and Dauid lifted vp their eyes towards heauen, they were caried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſingular vehemency.</p>

                  <hi>The vſe is,</hi> that in our prayer, we lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp our eies to the Lord, ſhould not doe it, as the hypocrites, without the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our minds: but that both the eyes and the affections of our minds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted vp to him together, we may be aſſured that he will heare vs. If we bée in daungers, he will deliuer vs; if in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, he will relieue vs; if in ſicknes,

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that Iohn ſaid, that Chriſt lifted vp his eyes towards heauen, it was no ſmall ſigne of zeale and feruentnes. For Chriſt teſtified in déed by this geſture, that he was rather in heauen by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his mind, then in earth, that he might talke familiarly with God. He looked vp towards heauen, not that God is ſhut vp there, who doth alſo fill the earth, <hi>Ierem. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </hi> but becauſe his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie appeareth there chiefly: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the beholding of heauen doth admoniſh vs, that the power of GOD farre paſſeth all creatures. To the ſame purpoſe ſerued the lifting vp of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, when he praied: for ſeing that men are ſlacke and ſlow by nature, and their earthly nature doth bend them downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they haue néed to bee ſtirred vp, thus yea, they haue néed of chariots to carrie them vp to God.</p>
               <p>But if wee deſire to imitate Chriſt and Dauid truly, we muſt take diligent héed, that our ceremonies expreſſe no

               <p>Whereas the Publican, <hi>Luk. <hi>18.13.</hi>
                  </hi> did rightly pray vnto God, caſting down his eies, it is not contrary to this both of Dauid &amp; Chriſt. For although, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Let vs put the caſe, that a man had al things els that could be imagined, and yet wanted this truſt and faith in his praier: ſurely all the reſt were nothing woorth, but ſhall bee turned into his bane.</p>
               <p>What if a man laugh, what if he liue in ioy &amp; pleaſure, what if he haue goods enough, and too much, what if all men honour him; and to be ſhort, what if he ſéeme to be a pety-God here below, as in a Paradiſe? Yet if hee haue not this priuiledge of reſorting vnto God, with conſtant and full beliefe, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him ſhall not be in vaine, but that his requeſts ſhalbe graunted; all that euer he can haue beſides, ſhalbe but
<pb facs="tcp:11412:72"/> a curſe vnto him, and an increaſe of his decay. Then let vs marke well, that it is not without fruite, that Dauid bringeth vs here to the principall point of our whole life, in the reſpect of the weale that we can wiſh, which is, that God ſhould be at hand with vs, and that wee ſhould reſort vnto him, that he ſhould heare vs, and that wee ſhould obtayne our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes, and bée helped and ayded at his hand, according to our neceſſitie, and as hee knoweth to bee conuenient for our welfare.

               <p>True it is, that by reaſon of our great dulneſſe wee conceyue not ſo much; but without all doubt, if wee had but one ſparke of ſound vnderſtanding, there is none of vs but ſhould comfortably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, that this Doctrine is very true.</p>
               <p>So then, let vs open our eies, &amp; learne to enioy this happineſſe, &amp; know, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſame is chiefly grounded, ſo as we may vnderſtand, that if we haue not

                  </label> The Solution is very eaſie, if wee waigh wel what is ſaid in the <hi>Pſal. <hi>145.18. The Lord is neere to all that call vpon him, yea, to al that call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in truth.</hi>
                  </hi> There the Prophet ſheweth, that many ſeeke God, howbeit fainedly. By reaſon whereof wee be conuinced, that there is none other meanes to rid vs of our miſeries, but onely that God ſhould take vs to his mercy, and be pitiful vnto vs. The very infidels call vpon him, without regard of him, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that they ſcorne at religion, and at all things that are ſpoken to vs in the ſacred Scriptures concerning Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, his mercy, and grace, which wee muſt looke for at his hands. Therefore if they be pinched with aduerſity, they cry, Alas, my God. And what compelleth them thereunto? Euen their mother wit.</p>
               <p>So the hypocrites and deſpiſers of God, may haue ſome forme or likenes of praying, not onely to ſpeake (but to ſpeake properly, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not pray in déed: for they are deſtitute of the Spirite ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their teeth outward, whiles their minds are otherwiſe buſied, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (as men may perceyue) euen with

For they haue not the knowledge to ſay, My God calleth and allureth mée vnto him, I ſhall not therefore loſe my labour in comming to him. Seing it is his good pleaſure to reckon and accompt mee in the number of his deerly beloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I will go to him, not on a fooliſh raſhnes and preſumption, but with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto the voice of my GOD, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to his promiſe. The hypocrites cannot ſpeake this language, therefore they haue no truth in them. For they muſt haue faith: and faith dependeth on the promiſes of God, which the wicked haue not, yea, neuer taſted of.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee muſt haue a féeling of our miſeries; ſo that when we approch vnto God, we muſt be abaſhed of our ſelues, we muſt be ſory for our ſinnes, we muſt hate our ſelues, and wee muſt acknowledge our ſelues to be excéeding miſerable. But the wicked, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites haue none of all theſe. Although then their mouths are open to call vpon God, yet do they but blaſpheme, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallow his holy name, becauſe their

                  <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropium,</hi> the herbe of the Sunne, ſo called, becauſe it windeth it ſelf about with the Sunne; in the morning very early, it doth (as it were) behold the riſing therof, and all the day it followeth the courſe of the Sunne, euer turning the leaues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſame, but the roote it neuer chaungeth, ſtirreth, nor mooueth, but hath that ſtil faſt fixed in the earth?

<pb facs="tcp:11412:75"/> the one from the other. How then can they poſſibly in faith cal vpon the Lord, that theyr prayers ſhould bee heard? And therefore they fulfill the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Eſay chap. <hi>29.13. This people draweth neere to mee with their lippes, but their heartes are farre from mee.</hi>

               <p>So then, lette vs marke well, that when God ſaith, that hee will heare the prayers of all them that call vpon him, hee meaneth, that their prayers muſt procéede from faith, and wée muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke our ſelues well beforehand of his promiſes, thereby to bée encouraged to come vnto him; yet wée muſt alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelues to be, as we ſurely are, of our ſelues forlorne, damnable, and deſtitute of all goodnes: and this we muſt be throughly perſwaded of, to the end that wée may reſort to the fountaine of his goodnes and grace.</p>
               <p>Now we ſée, there is no cauſe, why we ſhould thinke it ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, that God putteth hypocrits, &amp; wicked men back whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to him. For they come not with a willing mind, nor a pure affection: but they would willingly ſhunne and auoid
<pb facs="tcp:11412:76"/> his hand, if it were poſſible. Howbeit, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they, by no means poſſible that they can deuiſe, can ſhift themſelues from him, they come to him by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note>For euen as a theefe, a murtherer, or any other great malefactor, being ſhut vp in priſon, would not willingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the Iudge, but would wiſh in his heart, that rather there were none at all; but ſeing they are and muſt bee, full ſore againſt their willes, that ſinne might be puniſhed and vertue rewarded, they then humbly entreat him to ſhew mercie to them. Euen ſo, the wicked and hypocrites wiſh in their heart there were no God: but ſeing he is and wil be, they repayre to him, not as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of him, as of a louing and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full father, but as a ſeuere Iudge: but what profiteth that?</p>
               <p>Therefore when we pray vnto God, let vs offer vnto him free harted ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let vs haue acceſſe to him with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mindes, aſſuring our ſelues, that without him we are deſtitute of al things we want, &amp; of all that appertaine to our good.

               <p>True it is, that God euery minute ſheweth his goodnes towards vs; and although wée preſently perceiue it not, yet doth he preſerue vs from the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that hang ouer our head, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his louing hand betwéene vs and them.

For whenſoeuer miſery pincheth vs, and death threateneth vs, wée can diſcerne that we are wretched forlorne creatures, if God ſhould not ſtep before vs to reſcue vs.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake the truth more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: How great and grieuous were the ſorrowes, troubles, anguiſh and griefe of our ſoules, if wée had not this ſwéete conſideration?</p>
               <p>Yée ſée then an euident Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:77"/> that God hath had, and now hath mercy and compaſſion vpon vs. We ſée therefore, that affliction is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God chiefly ſheweth himſelf to be our ſauiour.</p>
               <p>Here we ſée, wherefore God ſaith in the <hi>Pſalm. <hi>50.15. Call vpon mee in the day of thy trouble, and I will heare thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie mee.</hi>
                  </hi> But ſhall we therefore inferre, that wée need not but in neceſſity to call vpon God? No: Then ſhould we be too rechles, if wée ſhould not call vpon him but conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly. Therefore it behoueth vs to call vpon him at all times, as more largely ſhall be ſhewed. Yet the Lord prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs by his whippes: and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he correcteth our ſlouthfulnes, and quickneth vs to come vnto him.</p>
               <p>It is expreſly ſaid, that that is the time to call vpon him, and that that is the due and very conuenient ſeaſon, as in the <hi>Pſalm. <hi>32.6. Therefore ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that is godly, make his praier vnto thee, in a time when thou maieſt be found: ſurely in a floud of great waters they ſhall not come neere him.</hi>
                  </hi> In the time, that is, when aduerſity preſſeth
<pb facs="tcp:11412:77"/> them. Not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue not occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, but our occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at any other time of proſperity.</p>
               <p>And hereby we are taught, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoeuer pouerty pincheth vs, perſecution afflicteth vs to the vttermoſt, ſo that we can endure no more, let vs not faint; but rather be encouraged to come to our gracious God, &amp; louing father, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that not onely by his worke, but by his word he allureth vs, &amp; that as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mother, when ſhée ſeeth that her child cannot ſtand, but by meanes of his weakenes is ready to fall flat to the ground, reacheth out her kind hand to ſtay him from falling: euen ſo our good &amp; gracious father doth not only reach vs his merciful ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; willeth vs to take it, but alſo, as it were by force, draweth vs by reaſon of our great ſluggiſhnes wée haue, to come to him.</p>
               <p>Alſo here withall let vs vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of our faith what it is. This it is.

<pb facs="tcp:11412:79"/> ſpareth them that are none of his, it is all one, as if we ſaw him before our eies. Therefore when God holdeth vs in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his will, it is an hiding of his face from vs.</p>

               <p>Do wée then ſée the ſtate of the world ſo troubled, that wée know not what to ſay? It is all one, as if GOD ſhould hide his face from vs. And in this caſe what haue wée els to do, but

               <p>If odious and deteſtable ſinnes bée committed, as if quarrelling, and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ariſeth, and if ſnares be layd by the wicked, ſo that by them the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are deſolated and impoueriſhed, ſo that they know not how to eſcape: then doth GOD, as it were, turne his face from vs.</p>
               <p>True it is, that hée is neuer the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from vs, nor hath the leſſe care of vs, howbeit wee can neyther ſée nor perceyue it. On the other ſide, when wée cannot conſider what is done, it ſéemeth to vs, that GOD regardeth vs not: wée ſée nothing but darknes, the light that ſhould guide vs, ſhineth not vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what muſt we do, but ſhrink downe our heads, cloſe our mouthes, &amp; wait Gods leyſure patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, vntill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that trouble vs?
<pb facs="tcp:11412:80"/> Alſo, let vs alwaies be at this point ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to enquire farther then it is lawfull for vs. Wée muſt be well perſwaded that God doth nothing without great cauſes; let vs enter rather into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our ſinnes: for if we curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enquire the ſecretes of God, and his incomprehenſible determinations, it is a pride that will vtterly ouerthrow vs. And therefore let vs learne not to be ouerwiſe, knowing that God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leadeth vs like poore blind ſoules.</p>
               <p>And wheras good Dauid was, by his enemies the wicked, oppreſſed, let vs learne, that although it be a ſore temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to ſée the wicked floriſh and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer the children of God, and to ſée that might ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth right, ſo that a man knoweth not whither to go for refuge, verily it is a very hard croſſe to ouercome: neuertheleſſe, the holy Ghoſt purpoſeth to ſet it before vs, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we ſhould be armed againſt it.</p>
               <p>So then, hath vnrighteouſnes gotten full ſcope? Are the wicked growen ſo headſtrong and luſty, that they confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all things? Do they handle ſo corruptly their matters, that there ſéemeth there

The Spirit of God aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeth vs, that it is Gods will to hide his face after that maner, to the end that thereby hee might trie our obedience.

                  </hi> for that is it, wherein all our ioy, bleſſedneſſe, and welfare conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>What is therefore moſt to be deſired of vs? the face and countenance of God: euen as contrariwiſe, when hee turneth his backe vpon vs, and hideth himſelfe from vs, we muſt of neceſſitie be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, miſerable, forlorne, and out of heart: for there is nothing wherein a man may finde reſt, but onely in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God hath a care of vs.</p>
               <p>So long then, as God vouchſafeth to
<pb facs="tcp:11412:81"/> caſt his fauourable face vpon vs, wee haue cauſe to reioyce and bee glad; for wée are aſſured that hée will maintaine vs, that wee ſhall haue no cauſe nor néede to dreade or feare any thing. But if GOD forget vs, and turne away his face from vs, wée are at our wits end, and that not without great cauſe. For then we are as it were, left open to ſathan to praie vpon vs, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand deaths beſet vs round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout without recouerie.</p>
               <p>We ſée then, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gods face is a thing to be prayed for, which wee ſhall haue, eſpecially, if we come to him by praier in all humbleneſſe, with a deſire, true and ful purpoſe and intent to cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

Wherfore with Dauid
<pb facs="tcp:11412:81"/> let vs hold downe our heads, and let vs goe vnto God, to doe him ſeruice and obedience; let vs pray vnto him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our eies, that we may ſeeke him as our good father; let vs beſéech him of his great goodnes &amp; vnſpeakeable mercie, that he would looke vpon vs in ſuch wiſe, that thereby we may haue al perfection of ioy and contentation to reſt vpon.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11412:84"/> attaine to comfort in affliction. Dauid did vnfainedly powre foorth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and ſorrowes vnto God. Hée was not benummed as infidels and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous (which among the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, like an huge ſtreame, lamentable it is to conſider thereof, do ouerflow Chriſtendome, this Land, yea, this Towne) are. If God handle them any thing roughly, they thinke, yea, many times they ſay, Sée this miſfortune that is happened vnto me: they looke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Dauid did not ſo. But he knew, and was fully reſolued, that it behooued him to impute theſe thinges vnto God. Had we learned this leſſon, we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited well for one day: I meane, if we had practiſed it throughly, as we ought to do. For moſt can well enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that diſeaſes, deaths, and other miſeries, as warres, plagues, famines, and all ſuch things come of God: but if it come to the proofe, wée are amazed, and not able to make this ſound conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion within our ſelues: Well, ſeeing that God viſiteth and commeth home vnto vs, it behoueth vs now to returne vnto him.</p>

               <p>But contrariwiſe, how deale wée in that behalfe? If a man be afflicted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way, either in the loſſe of his goods, of his libertie, of his life, or be gréeued in ſpirite, what will hée elſe doe, but chafe and grind his téeth in grudging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? Wherefore, no doubt, if a man tell him, he hath offended GOD, he will eaſily grant it to bee true: but hee hath no true remorſe to reſtraine himſelfe. Wherefore? Becauſe wee haue but a confuſed conceite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Hereby it is euedent, that few they are, and ſmal is the number of perſons, that haue this leſſon well printed in their hearts: That all afflictions are Gods Archers: and that hée is garded with them, to ſhew himſelfe to be our Iudge.</p>
               <p>As much is to be ſaid of the ordinary
<pb facs="tcp:11412:85"/> aduerſities, that GOD commonly inflicteth. If people, or a whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie bee touched with warre; when pollings, extortions, and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages are there done: how many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are there that thinke vpon the Lord?</p>
               <p>Wee ſée, that all is out of order to our ſéeming, yet wee conſider not that God guideth the ſterne. When we ſée ſuch turmoylings, we are admoniſhed to marke and not ſo much the more the ſacred Scriptures, wherein GOD ſheweth vs, as in a looking glaſſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as in a liuely picture, that on what ſide ſoeuer man be afflicted, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him to acknowledge the ſame to be the hand of GOD: and eſpecially, if an whole country be plagued, it muſt be acknowledged to be Gods viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when any ſuch thing commeth, let vs follow the example of Dauid, to deſire our good and gracious GOD to extende his holy hand, and powre forth his bowels of compaſſion vpon vs. When we are ſcourged, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can (to our thinking) beare no more his
<pb facs="tcp:11412:86"/> heauie hand in afflicting vs, let vs flie to our good God for ſuccour. And if we wéepe before him, ſo it be with true low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ſurely there ſhall not one teare droppe from our eyes, which ſhall not come to be accompted of in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

When we ſhall ſée the whole world cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, ſo that we are, as it were among bryars, and can ſée nothing but euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, let vs reſiſt all ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Wherefore? If wee be ſo lazie, as to
<pb facs="tcp:11412:87"/> make excuſe, that becauſe the world is wicked and froward, wee may wel doe as others doe, that is fond and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: for Lot, Iob, and Ioſhua are ſet before vs to condemne vs.</p>
               <p>For if Lot were ſo iuſt, that hée not onely abſtained from the groſſe ſinnes, (excepting drunkenneſſe and inceſt, which hee committed) as pride, fulneſſe of bread, aboundance of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vnmercifulneſſe, and that nameleſſe ſinne which they committed, but that for their ſinnes his ſoule was vexed from day to day, in ſéeing their abominations; If iuſt Ioſeph abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from that ſinne of whoredome, whereunto his miſtreſſe (not without promiſe of great preferment (as it is probable) did allure and tempt him; If Iob the iuſt abſtained from euill; If Ioſhua, whatſoeuer others would, yet hée and his houſhold would ſerue the Lord; ought not wee then in theſe daungerous dayes to doe the like, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſéeing the Lord giueth vs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that we cannot liue holy without great battailes?</p>
               <p>The Lord of his vnſpeakeable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

For they liued not in times when all things were well ordered, or when men were as Angelles. No, they liued among I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, aboundance of wickedneſſe raigned in their time, there was as great ſtore of vice that raigned in the world then, as there is at this day. Yet notwithſtanding, they followed not the bent of other mens bowes, as the Prouerbe is, but they retired to them ſelues, being well aſſured, that they ought to ſerue God.</p>
               <p>So then, let none of vs in theſe daies (wherein wickedneſſe hath gotten the vpper hand) alleadge the corruption of the time, in that all goodneſſe is turned topſi-turuy, but rather let vs conſider, that God by the meanes thereof prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to bee ſo much the more careful, by all poſſible meanes to ſhunne and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd thoſe things, that may any way infect vs. For ſeeing that wee plainely perceiue that vices are, as it were, an euill aire, we muſt flie from them:

               <p>Wherefore then are we not carefull, ſéeing that the Lorde himſelfe ſheweth vs, that all the vices in the world, are as badde as deadly plagues? And ſéeing that the Lord, of his great mercy had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them his ſpirite, to abſtaine euen from, not onely euill, but from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of euill: let vs not doubt, but if we by feruent and deuout prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire vnto him, that at this day he will aſſiſt vs with like power.</p>

For it is too high a point of wiſedome to grow in the mind of man, it muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed of the frée goodnes of our God; the holy Ghoſt muſt firſt haue ſoftened that curſed hardnes and ſtubbornes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto wée are enclined of nature, euer ſince the tranſgreſſion of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Adam and Eue.</p>

               <p>But yet wil this ſaying ſéeme ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge after the opinion of the fleſh: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer afflictions or tribulations fal out otherwiſe then we would haue them, wée terme them aduerſities.</p>
               <p>When we ſuffer any hunger, thirſt, cold, or heate, wée ſay that euery one of theſe is an aduerſitie. Why ſo? The reaſon is, becauſe wée would willingly haue our owne appetites and deſires fulfilled in all things.</p>
               <p>And in good ſooth, this manner of ſpeach, to ſay, (that the afflictions and tribulations that GOD ſendeth vpon vs, are aduerſities, that is to ſay, things againſt vs) is not without reaſon.
<pb facs="tcp:11412:92"/> Neuertheleſſe we muſt vnderſtand the end of them: namely, that Gods ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of vs, is becauſe of our ſinnes. And therefore by flattering our ſelues, let vs not beguile our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I haue already prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto you, not onely that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for vs to conſider, that Gods ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of vs, is, becauſe he hateth ſinne, and that his ſummoning of vs before him, is to make vs to feele him to be our Iudge: but alſo, that we had néede of him, to reach out his armes vnto vs, and to ſhew vs, that he is ready to be at one with vs, whenſoeuer wee ſhall come to him by true repentance.</p>
               <p>So then, we perceiue that they, whom God chaſteneth, are happie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that we ſhunne aduerſitie as much as we poſſibly can.

               <p>The cauſes of Gods ſeuerity againſt ſuch great and gréeuous ſinners, are waighty. For firſt it is an inexcuſable raſhnes and preſumption, to ſearch out the knowledge of thoſe things which the Lord will not haue to be knowen.</p>
               <p>This raſh preſumption is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, in the <hi>Acts <hi>1.7,</hi>
                  </hi> when he anſwered to his Diſciples, aſking him, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore the kingdome to Iſrael? And hee ſaid vnto them, It is not for you to know the time or the ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his owne power.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, it derogateth from the goodneſſe and glorie of God, as though that the Lord had not faithfully taught all things in the ſacred Scriptures, which were neceſſarie to be knowne of vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it taketh from Chriſt that honour which is due to him, which of God is giuen a Doctor and teacher vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and in whome all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge are hidde, as Paul teacheth.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore this poynt, let vs not ſéeke vnto them, but vnto our God in our afflictions: then will he help vs, and deliuer vs out of our miſeries: for hee is a God of power, and therefore is able; a God of mercie, and therefore is willing to deliuer vs out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for as a father hath pitie vpon his children, ſo is the Lord merciful to thoſe that truſt in him.</p>

                  <hi>The vſe is,</hi> to teach vs, firſt, that it is the lot of the godly, to be puniſhed by the wicked: ſo was Chriſt: ſo were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets: then let vs looke for it, and not murmur at it, nor ſhrinke from the truth of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſinne is a moſt vglie thing in Gods ſight, that cauſeth him to deale ſo ſeuerely with his deareſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that we take héede of béeing in league with the wicked: for they are our enemies, and muſt ſcourge vs.</p>
               <p>If men do hate vs and deſpiſe vs, let it put vs in mind, that wée haue not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued our GOD, and therefore it is good reaſon that wee ſhould receiue ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of hatred vpon our heads.</p>
               <p>God then entendeth to trie our lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and patience in this behalfe, by our
<pb facs="tcp:11412:98"/> méeke receiuing of the iniuries that men do to vs, without ſtomaking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For this delicate bringing vs vp in eaſe, without enemies, at our pleaſures, cauſeth vs to bee impatient, ſo as wee cannot beare any thing; ſo as if a man do but paſſe by vs with a frowning countenance, it gréeueth vs, yea, it is ſuch a coroſiue vnto vs, that wee know not which way to turne vs.</p>
               <p>Then if the Lord our God inure vs to the ſuffering of enmities, wrongs, and reproches, let vs learne, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee procureth our welfare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, to the intent that wee ſhould be all whole and ſound, as they ſay.</p>
               <p>And this is the cauſe that S. Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7.</note> that it behooueth vs to bee armed on both ſides, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee may paſſe through enmitie, ſhame, and reproch, as through amitie, glorie, and honour.</p>
               <p>If men hate and deteſt vs, let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe take all patiently, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that we haue heretofore not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the wayes of God, although that now wee doe. For this is a moſt true ſaying, and worthie of al men to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and learned, that no affliction
<pb facs="tcp:11412:99"/> commeth vpon vs, but for our ſinnes, and if he now afflict vs, and we walke in his wayes, hee doth it, that wee may not bee ouercome of the ſame, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee nowe giueth vs power to beare it.</p>
               <p>And thereupon it behooueth euerie one of vs, to bethinke himſelfe aduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and as ſoone as any man ſhall hate and perſecute any of vs, we muſt learn to acknowledge, that God putteth vs in minde, to make our owne accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Euen the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Philoſophers would ſay, that our deadly enemies doe many times profite vs more then our friends. Wherefore? Our friendes beare with vs oftentimes, which cauſeth vs to féed our owne vices. For although their intent bée not to flatter vs, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the gentleneſſe (or rather the crueltie) that they vſe in bearing with vs, is a cauſe that wée thinke not vpon our imperfections, to amende them. But our enemies doe praye vpon vs, and ſéeke all the meanes that may bee, to lay open all the faults that are in vs.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11412:99"/>
               <p>Therefore, when any man hateth or findeth fault with vs, it behooueth vs to thinke thus: I ſée, that God here citeth mée to make mine owne proces, and to accuſe my ſelfe, that I may bee mine owne Iudge, to condemne my ſelfe, that by ſo doing my ſhame may be couered and buried.</p>
               <p>And if wee know that ſuch as hate vs, haue cauſe ſo to doe, although they doe it of malice: yet notwithſtanding, lette vs not replie to ſay, that this man is ledde by Sathan to reuenge, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee true) lette vs not looke on any ſuch things: but let vs pleade guiltie, and pray vnto GOD, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, to blot out all our offences, to the end wée may bee quitte both before GOD and the world. Yea, although wee know not any reaſon why our enemies ſhould hate vs in that behalfe; yet let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that although we bee not guiltie in that poynt whereof wee are blamed, yet haue wee many other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof wee are guiltie, but our good God ſpareth vs, and will not haue them come to the knowledge of men.
<pb facs="tcp:11412:100"/> If it pleaſed him to ſtirre abroad all our filthineſſe, what a ſtinke would there be?</p>
               <p>Let vs conſider, that by that meanes God inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, to ſet ſecretly before our eies, the ſinne which wee would haue caſt behind our backs, and that is to make vs to hate the euill that is in vs, without any flattering of our ſelues.</p>
               <p>If men do blame vs for executing of our offices and duties faithfully, for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Gods word zealouſly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, lette vs aſſure our ſelues, that Gods will is, that our receiuing of ſuch a reward, ſhall bee, to the end that wee ſhould looke for a better at his hand.</p>
               <p>And if wee ſée no cauſe at all, but are vtterly abaſhed in our ſelues, let vs not therefore ceaſe to ſay, O Lord, thou art righteous, whatſoeuer come of it.</p>
               <p>And herewithall let vs endeuour to profite our ſelues, by all the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God ſendeth vs from day to day, and let vs vnderſtand, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God intendeth to faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs to praiſe and glorifie him, euen when wee ſée good men hated and perſecuted. For as euerie one of vs ought to bee patient,
<pb facs="tcp:11412:100"/> and by his patience to praiſe God for all things that hee ſuffereth, ſo alſo muſt we not blame him, but rather as Dauid here doth, pray vnto him, when we ſée him ſuffer good men to bee hated and perſecuted: wherefore, lette vs not bée too much grieued, when wee ſée them ſo hardly vſed. Wée ſée Dauids eſtate: he was a patterne of al holineſſe, a man after Gods owne heart; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, we ſée him in ſuch miſery by the hatred of his enemies, that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee vtterly paſt recouerie.</p>
               <p>Can we blame God in this behalfe? Nay rather, when wée ſée ſuch afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come vpon others, or our ſelues, lette vs humble our ſelues. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the reaſon why God doth ſo, be not apparant vnto vs: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, let vs aſſure our ſelues, that GOD doth it not without cauſe; and therefore wee ought to glorifie him in all his iudgements, although they bee incomprehenſible to vs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The vſe is,</hi> That as we would be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we hope in God, ſo alſo that wee exerciſe prayer, ſéeing that wee cannot aſſure our ſelues of the cauſe, without the effect.

                  </hi> that he doth reiect, and giueth no heede vnto them: whereby we almoſt thinke it in vaine to pray, ſéeing that we finde no releaſe. But this is our weakeneſſe, and frailtie of our fleſh, which will not willingly bee ſubdued to the ſpirite: Which lette vs beſéech the Lord to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs, for hee ſéeth our conflicts, and looketh vpon our continuall ſighes and petitions, but hee deferreth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth his helpe the longer, and doth not at the firſt helpe vs; to this ende, that wee may ſée fully our owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, learne by little and little to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our rebellions to his gratious will, who knoweth better what is meete for vs, then we for our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Therefore lette vs beſeech him to ſtrengthen vs by his holie ſpirite, that wee may ſtill perſeuere and continue in prayer, and with longing deſires pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently waite for him, being fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that although it preſently appeare not, yet hee is alwaies preſent with vs, and heareth our ſighes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and will, when hee ſeeth his time, declare himſelfe manifeſtly, in

               <p>This holy Prouerbe teacheth, that wickedneſſe maketh the wicked verie fearefull, and that righteouſneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the innocent ſecure and bold.</p>
               <p>In it firſt, the wicked man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to a bird, or ſome ſuch timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous creature, which betaketh it ſelfe to flight, when no cauſe is offered.

The Lord had cauſed the campe of the Aramites to heare a noyſe of chariots, and a noyſe of horſes, and a noyſe of a great armie, ſo that they ſayd one to another, Behold, the kind of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el hath hired againſt vs the kings of the

But the iuſt, as is affirmed in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place, are like a yong Lion, which is couragious. For he goeth on his way boldly and ſwiftly, without returning backe for feare of any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reaſon is.</hi> For that being at peace with God, &amp; hauing a good cauſe, and a ſound conſcience, he dreadeth no obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction nor daunger.</p>
               <p>This ſame Integritie therefore, is like Noahs Arke, wherein he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, that were without, periſhed.

               <p>So is this vprightnes of ſmal recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe) with men of this world, which thinke that there is none other heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but earth: But as Rahabs thred

If they haue this within they care not, nay, they néed not care what can come without.</p>
               <p>If Sathans buffetting come, this is an helmet of proofe; if Sathans dartes flie, this is a ſhield to quench them, if floods of troubles come to carrie vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, this is a ſhippe to beare vs vp; if all the world caſt myre and filth in our faces, wée are not a whitte the more deformed, but ſtill beautifull: <hi>For the Kings daughter is all beautifull with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.13.</hi>
